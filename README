Plask is a programming environment for multimedia and computational design.

- Building

Plask integrates together quite a few pieces of technology, which unfortunately
makes the build process more complicated.  It is possible to do a boostrapped
build, where you only build the Plask source file, but use prebuilt object
files for Plask's dependencies.  Run the fetch_deps.sh script to download and
extract a copy of these prebuilt dependencies.  When fetching new source
changes to Plask, you will have to be aware if there have been any changes to
the prebuilt dependencies, and if so, to run fetch_deps.sh again.
